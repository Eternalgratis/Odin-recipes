       <div class="section">
           <ul>
               <li>1 medium Coconut</li>
               <li>200 gram white granulated/castor sugar</li>
               <li>125ml/half a cup of water</li>
           </ul>
       </div>
       <h3>Tip: A good substitute for white sugar in this recipe is unrefined cane sugar (panela)</h3>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <div class="section">
           <ol>
               <li>Break the coconut and pry out the flesh. Grate the coconut flash and set aside</li>
               <li>Combine the water and sugar in a pot and boil on medium heat. Without stirring</li>
               <li>As the mixture begins to look thicker and color chnages to a very light brown. Reduce the heat to low. Add the coconut and mix thoroughly with a spatula, until it is well incorporated</li>
               <li>Keep pn stiring until the mixture is a browner color and feels grainy on your spatula. Then put off the heat.</li>
               <li>Tip: The sugar caramelizes faster at this stage, and can get burnt and ruin the recipe. So watch it closely</li>
               <li>Transfer the coconut candy into a wide tray, spread out and leave to cool a bit</li>
               <li>You can mold into any shape of choice or simply leave it to cool completely and harden. Then cut into square or rectangles</li>
               <li>Place in the freezer or refrigerator  to harden faster</li>
               <li>To get a very hard candy, you will have to increase the amount of sugar used (some people likes their coconut hard and crunchy, depending on your peference)</li>
               <li>Your Nigerian Coconut is ready. YUM!</li>
